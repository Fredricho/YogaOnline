                <p>I started the Yin-yoga class as a beginner and I loved it from start to end! Now I'm on the advanced
                    class in Yin and it's as fantastic as the beginner class. </p>

                <p>I've practiced some yoga before and thought that I was quite skilled. But after the Ashtanga-class I
                    relaized that I was at a beginner level, now I can safley say that I'm skilled! Thank you Lindy and

                <p>My sister gave me a class last christmas and I was a bit skeptical to do Yoga "Online". But i changed
                    my mind, It's a huge asset to be able to practice at any time and from where you are on your phone
